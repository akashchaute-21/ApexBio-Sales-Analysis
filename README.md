# ApexBio-Sales-Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of three datasets provided by ApexBio Pharmaceuticals for the purpose of increasing sales of their product "Fludara" used in the treatment of blood cancers. The analysis aims to answer nine important questions related to physician targeting, hospital affiliations, product sales, and workload index calculations.

## Questions and approach:

**Data Checks:** We begin by applying data validation checks to ensure data accuracy and reliability.

**Product Sales Over Time:** A graph illustrates the sales (total prescriptions) of "Fludara" and its competitor "Mercapto" over time, providing key insights into product performance.

**Top 200 Target Physicians:** We identify and explain the approach for targeting the top 200 physicians critical for promoting "Fludara."

**Hospitals without Target Physicians:** We determine how many hospitals do not have any of the top 200 target physicians affiliated with them.

**Top 5 Hospitals by Specialty:** We list the top 5 hospitals based on the number of physicians from specific specialties: "Hematology," "Hematology/Oncology," "Oncology Medical," and "Pediatric Hematology Oncology."

**Workload Index Calculation:** We calculate the Workload Index for all territories as per defined steps.

**Territories Workload Analysis:** We categorize territories as above and below the balanced workload index range (700-1,300) to assess workload distribution.

**Workload Index Graph:** A graph displays the workload index for all territories in descending order, highlighting the best-performing region based on "Fludara" sales.
